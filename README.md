# SpottyMute
Two Scripts: one script echos 'now playing' information for clementine, spotify, and cmus. The other mutes the system during spotify ads, then unmutes once the ad is over. Includes script for the MATE taskbar.

(Sloppily) calls on spotifycli https://github.com/pwittchen/spotify-cli-linux, Clementine np -n https://github.com/makos/clementine-np and CMUS's now playing
https://github.com/cmus/cmus/wiki/status_display_short_text.sh to do the heavy lifting.
